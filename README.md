# This is the mobile app version of Mirror Image, your personal emotional support bot.

## How to use this:
If you are an android user, you can download this android studio on your desktop, connect your device, and run the machine. This will download the application on your device.

## How to contribute:
Since this is an open source, if you wish to change the UI, you are very welcomed to do so. Some part of the UI that we could not get to in time consisted of making transition between different layouts and transitions for buttons.

Also, if you wish to add more Microsoft Azure utility to this project (more found on: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/?v=18.06), you can go into the languages section and view what you want to add (We suggest the Speech recognition one)

Lastly, as an emotional support robot, we wanted to implement a special function where people with high sentiment can write words of inspiration for those who are going through some rough time. This can be done by using firebase or any other database by saving the messages of high sentiment people and distributing the message to those who are having a low day.
